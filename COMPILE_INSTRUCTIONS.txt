# Compile instructions
The entire project can be built using CMake. There is also an INSTALL target that will copy the public headers and all executables and libraries according to the CMake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. Note that this does not copy the required DLLs, which must be done manually.

## GPU
After configuring CMake, some extra steps must be done. It is very important to set CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS to the correct architecture and compute capability. For a Quadro K4000M device, the following was successfully used:
    CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS=-gencode arch=compute_30,code=sm_30

Not setting this variable may result in strange behavior. For the K4000M device, the compiling was successful with empty CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS, but device refused to have more than 65535 as grid size x-component at runtime.

It is also possible to add the flag -use_fast_math, in which case the variable should look like:
    CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS=-gencode arch=compute_30,code=sm_30;-use_fast_math
