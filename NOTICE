               The OpenBCSim Ultrasound Simulator Project
              ============================================
This project is a fast C++/CUDA open-source implementation of an ultrasound
simulator based on the COLE algorithm as published by Gao et al. in [1].
The algorithm has been extended to optionally use B-splines for representing
dynamic point scatterers. Both CPU implementations and (experimental) GPU
implementations are provided.

This project contains files from the "numpy-boost" project, a wrapper to make
Numpy arrays accessible in C++ as boost::multiarray objects, which is written
by Michael Droettboom and can be obtained from
    https://github.com/mdboom/numpy-boost


This project contains a Qt5-based GUI where the GLScattererWidget widget which
is responsible for rendering the visualized scatterers and scanlines using 
OpenGL is inspired by the "Hello GL2 Example", which can be obtained from
    http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtopengl-hellogl2-example.html
